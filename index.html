      <h2>What Is Drug Addiction?</h2>
      <h3>Understanding Drug Use and Addiction DrugFacts</h3>
      <p>
        Many people don't understand why or how other people become addicted to
        drugs. They may mistakenly think that those who use drugs lack moral
        principles or willpower and that they could stop their drug use simply
        by choosing to. In reality, drug addiction is a complex disease, and
        quitting usually takes more than good intentions or a strong will. Drugs
        change the brain in ways that make quitting hard, even for those who
        want to. Fortunately, researchers know more than ever about how drugs
        affect the brain and have found treatments that can help people recover
        from drug addiction and lead productive lives.

        Most drugs affect the brain's "reward circuit," causing euphoria as well
        as flooding it with the chemical messenger dopamine. A properly
        functioning reward system motivates a person to repeat behaviors needed
        to thrive, such as eating and spending time with loved ones. Surges of
        dopamine in the reward circuit cause the reinforcement of pleasurable
        but unhealthy behaviors like taking drugs, leading people to repeat the
        behavior again and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a person continues to use drugs, the brain adapts by reducing the
        ability of cells in the reward circuit to respond to it. This reduces
        the high that the person feels compared to the high they felt when first
        taking the drug an effect known as tolerance. They might take more of
        the drug to try and achieve the same high. These brain adaptations often
        lead to the person becoming less and less able to derive pleasure from
        other things they once enjoyed, like food, sex, or social activities.

      <p>Points to Remember about Drug Addiction</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Drug addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and
          use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful
          consequences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brain changes that occur over time with drug use challenge an addicted
          persons self-control and interfere with their ability to resist
          intense urges to take drugs. This is why drug addiction is also a
          relapsing disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Relapse is the return to drug use after an attempt to stop. Relapse
          indicates the need for more or different treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most drugs affect the brain's reward circuit by flooding it with the
          chemical messenger dopamine. Surges of dopamine in the reward circuit
          cause the reinforcement of pleasurable but unhealthy activities,
          leading people to repeat the behavior again and again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Over time, the brain adjusts to the excess dopamine, which reduces the
          high that the person feels compared to the high they felt when first
          taking the drug an effect known as tolerance. They might take more of
          the drug, trying to achieve the same dopamine high.
